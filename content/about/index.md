I'm Rhianna Stuart, a Junior Software Developer at the Financial Times working in the Operations and Reliability team.  My curiosity for tech made me take a leap of faith and learn something new. Being a challenge seeker there's not much I won't attempt to do. I began my coding journey with Generation after getting onto their Tech Talent Accelerator in April 2020, I discovered my love for coding and building things!
