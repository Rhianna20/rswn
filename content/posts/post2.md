The week has been different to my usual routine which may involve working on a ticket, building my apprentice project and attending meetings. Tech Debt Week is a week dedicated to cleaning up and updating FT's github repos. Never thought I'd see so much fun in working through a spreadsheet ticking off tasks one after the other.

 I got a chance to look through loads of repos, gained a better understanding of the difference between package.json, node_modules and package.json.lock.. My explanation/ is a bit fuzzy but with time I will be a pro. Its a strange feeling having some sort of understanding of a tool but not knowing how to explain its purpose. Learnt the importance of reading the README before working on an a repo or even just to get a small understanding of its purpose, seems a bit obvious.. now that I know aha. 
I enjoyed getting a hang of git and his commands. Getting into the habit of NOT using the master branch unless using git pull and keeping on track with pull requests and the reviews on github. 


My typical terminal routine throughout Tech Debt Week:

 - $ git clone https://www.github.com/randomRepo

 - $ cd randomRepo/
 - $ git branch
 - *master
- $ git branch techDebt2021

- $ git checkout techDebt2021


proceed to edit file. Once happy with my changes..

- $ git push





We began Tech Debt Week with 76% coverage,and ended the week.. *inserts drumroll*.. with 95%!
