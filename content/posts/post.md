<!-- A month into my placement and I've learnt about MakeFiles, .gitignore, front matter, toml, git on top of everything I've learnt, I finally built my blog!  -->

I began placement excited and curious,throughout the christmas holidays my mind would often wonder off due to excitement and nervousness. I wanted to know what sort of tickets I’d work on as a developer in the Reliability and Engineering team, i couldn't even take a guess, I was clueless. Being put into Tier 4, shook the tables my plans were scraped, with so much uncertainty I really didn't know what to expect. A month in and I am feeling optimistic and beyond excited as my journey continues.

First week at the FT:
- I was introduced to the Rel-eng team via google meets
- I was also introduced via Email to the whole of FT!.. I can't help but cringe at the sight of the paragraph I wrote about myself to be sent out.
- Setting up my computer took me 3 days
- Was introduced to FT systems and software
- Broke some code trying to figure out how it works
- Was introduced to front matter.
- Got my first ticket which was to not allow draft pages to be displayed to users
- Ended the week making my first pr!

Bootcamp  helped prepare me with communicating with new people via message  or video calls at work, which is something I struggled with throughout bootcamp. Many times I found myself overthinking a question so much that I put myself off of asking the person  which led to me spending hours trying to do something I did not understand.  Communicating your issues and how someone can help be the solution is a skill I need to work on.

Working on my first ticket, I was able to relax and ask questions. However communicating clearly has been difficult especially when I don't know what is needed. I blame being in lockdown for my socially awkwardness. Joining FT, I was advised to join different company networks as a way to network and meet people you wouldn't usually work with. FT Embrace caught my eye as they are a group committed to creating and maintaining a supportive environment for all. This is something i am passionate about, looking forward to getting involved. Need to be careful of not taking on more than I can handle.

Having the right support will only lead to growth. 3 weeks in and I don’t even feel hesitate to speak on my positive experiences. Especially being an active over-thinker, I am pleasantly surprised at how friendly and welcoming people are as a whole. I have never experienced this in a paying job, crazy right! The only jobs I can shout about how great my experience was when I worked as a  bartender (free drinks galore!) and in my unpaid internships, this is a new experience.
