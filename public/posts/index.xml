      <description>I began placement excited and curious,throughout the christmas holidays my mind would often wonder off due to excitement and nervousness. I wanted to know what sort of tickets Iâ€™d work on in the Reliability and Engineering team, i couldn&amp;rsquo;t even take a guess, I was clueless.
